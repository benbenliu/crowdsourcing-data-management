This folder contains the 'IC' (Image Comparison) dataset. 19 workers were given 48 questions each. Each task consisted of comparing two sports photos, and answering if the two photos contain the same person (each photo contained exactly one person). Their responses are in the file 'IC_Data.txt'. Each line correponds to one task, where the responses of the 19 workers are separated by spaces. '0' means a 'no', while '1' means a 'yes'. The first worker's responses thus consist of the first number in each line, the second worker's are the second numbers in each line, and so on. 
Correct answers are given in the file 'IC_Gold.txt'. Again, each line corresponds to one question, a '0' stands for 'no, and a '1' stands for 'yes'.
